### OECD Time Use  

The OECD Time Use Database provides information on how women and men spend their time. Data are currently available for 30 OECD countries. Differences in survey features, the number of diary days sampled, and the categorisation of activities may all affect the cross-country comparability of results. To improve the comparison of time use across countries, the samples are restricted to populations aged 15-64 and activities are aggregated into five main categories: (1) Unpaid work; (2) Paid work or study; (3) Personal care; (4) Leisure; and (5) Other time use.  

12 June 2024: New data are available for Austria (2021/22), Japan (2021) and the United States (2022)  

A more detailed breakdown of daily activities is available [here](https://github.com/bb-github74/NearDecomposition/blob/main/Data/OECD-time-use-database-updates.xlsx)


### UNSDG  

Time-use statistics are quantitative summaries of how individuals “spend” or allocate their time over a specified period— typically over a day or a week. They describe the daily life of a population in terms of what people do, how much time they spend, and the context of those activities.

Time-use statistics are used to analyze policies, particularly to measure unpaid household service work, well-being, and gender equality. They are also critical to guide policies and research related to all forms of work, care, commuting, and transportation as well as education, health, culture, environment, and sports. Over time, time-use statistics also offer meaningful insights into the changing patterns of how people use their time and the impact that technologies, such as the Internet, have on how people allocate their time.
